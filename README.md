# Dental-Practice-Database

### Description:   
This project consists of a database management system created to cater for a small dentistry business.  
A relational database was created based on the narrative prompt found in the Narrative.pdf file.  
The database adheres to Codd's Rules, with the Codd's_Rule.pdf file offering evidence as to how this was demonstrated.  
A view of the Relational Schema is found in the Relational_Schema.pdf file.  

### How to run:  
Start Apache and MySQL in the XAMPP Control Panel.  
Through your web browser, go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/. Import the dentist.sql file to the database. This will set up a database, consisting of tables, views, and dummy data. 

### Technology used:
- SQL  
- XAMPP Server
